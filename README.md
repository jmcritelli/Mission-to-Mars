# Mission to Mars!

Robin wanted to gather data for the Mission to Mars and store it in a central location to be displayed for others. She wants to build a web application that will scrape new data every time she wants it to at the click of a button. We will be building a python script that navigates the webpages to collect the info. Once we have all the info, we will be storing it using MongoBD.
